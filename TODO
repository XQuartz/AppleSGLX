Verify the XError behavior of GLXPixmap support functions.

Test GLXPixmap support with various pixmap depths.

Test GLXPixmap support with invalid pixmaps (to stress the protocol code).

Make apple_visual_create_pfobj not use OffScreen always.
I suspect we can add a bool that indicates whether or not to create such
an object.  We can also recreate the context, or possibly reconfigure it.

Finish glXDestroyGLXPixmap().

Test glXDestroyGLXPixmap().

Add support for the newer GLX glXCreatePixmap.

-- Feb 10, 2009

Test glXCopyContext.

Add the PBUFFER_BIT to the fbconfigs/visualconfigs in the X server.

DONE Test the pbuffer by using glReadPixels to verify it's being written to.

PLAN Handle GLX_LARGEST_PBUFFER (it's unclear how to handle this so far).

DONE glXQueryDrawable support for Pbuffer drawables.

DONE make glXSelectEvent() a no-op.

-- Feb 9, 2009

DONE Add glDrawBuffersARB to the exclusion list, and make it forward to the glDrawBuffers().

-- Feb 7, 2009

Extend the GL_aliases for compatibility with the old libGL (wherever possible).


-- Feb 5, 2009

DONE glXUseXFont needs the xfont.c code imported from Mesa.

DONE Test Chimera with AppleSGLX.

DONE Test Pymol again with AppleSGLX.

(from my paper notes)

DONE: glXSwapBuffers should do an implicit glFlush according to the GLX 1.4 spec.

DONE The first time a context is made current we should set the glViewport and glScissor according to the GLX 1.4 spec to the size of the new drawable.

DONE test glXQueryServerString, glXGetClientString, and glXGetProcAddress.

Use CGLGetVersion to assert ABI major version compatibility with the OpenGL framework.

Work out the include/GL/gl.h problems (with the ARB functions).

Install the new headers with the install target.

Fix the missing #define for glxinfo IIRC or one of the glx-based programs from Mesa.  We need to define the necessary functions and features for the relevant GL and GLX extensions.  I also need to find a good indication of what extensions to enable on the server side for telling clients what we support.

Generate include/GL/gl.h as needed.

TEST Shared contexts may work now, test them.

DONE DestroyContext needs some work perhaps for the drawable destruction.

TEST glXCopyContext needs some work and additional code in apple_glx.c.

-- OLD:

Add glxext.h support, and support functions.

----


Don't forget to check with otool -L to make sure the right library is being used before release!

Make sure we report the proper list of GLX extensions available.  Apple direct may not support some that Mesa does, and vice-versa.

Modify create_destroy_context and create a new test called create_destroy_context_thread_race.  Where 2 threads are doing the same sort of path of create and destroy.  The locking should protect us there, but we need to verify nothing goes wrong.
