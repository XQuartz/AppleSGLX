(from my paper notes)

DONE: glXSwapBuffers should do an implicit glFlush according to the GLX 1.4 spec.

The first time a context is made current we should set the glViewport and glScissor according to the GLX 1.4 spec to the size of the new drawable.

test glXQueryServerString, glXGetClientString, and glXGetProcAddress.

Use CGLGetVersion to assert ABI major version compatibility with the OpenGL framework.

Work out the include/GL/gl.h problems (with the ARB functions).

Install the new headers with the install target.

Use the install binary for installing the libGL.1.2.dylib.

Fix the missing #define for glxinfo IIRC or one of the glx-based programs from Mesa.  We need to define the necessary functions and features for the relevant GL and GLX extensions.  I also need to find a good indication of what extensions to enable on the server side for telling clients what we support.

Generate include/GL/gl.h as needed.

Shared contexts may work now, test them.

DestroyContext needs some work perhaps for the drawable destruction.

glXCopyContext needs some work and additional code in apple_glx.c.

-- OLD:

Add glxext.h support, and support functions.

Don't forget to check with otool -L to make sure the right library is being used before release!

Make sure we report the proper list of GLX extensions available.  Apple direct may not support some that Mesa does, and vice-versa.

Modify create_destroy_context and create a new test called create_destroy_context_thread_race.  Where 2 threads are doing the same sort of path of create and destroy.  The locking should protect us there, but we need to verify nothing goes wrong.
