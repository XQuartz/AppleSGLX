The client and server programs are protypes to test the behavior
of GLXPixmap shared memory in a controlled environment

The client faults after munmapping and truncating its fd, but the
server keeps going.  This is a good thing from a security perspective.

The client sees the servers changes, and the server can see the
client changes, but the server won't fault if the file is truncated.
