A lot of the code is automatically generated.

The following are generated based on specs/gl.spec and specs/enum.spec (from OpenGL.org):

apple_xgl_api.h
apple_xgl_api.c
exports.list
include/GL/gl.h (this probably might as well just be an include of the OpenGL framework GL)
include/GL/glext.h (includes the OpenGL framework glext.h)

The gen_code.tcl script is what executes the various gen_*.tcl scripts to produce those.

You will need Tcl 8.5 for the gen_code.tcl script.

The tests/ directory contains some tests that are built in builds/.
(TODO move the libGL.dylib and libGL.1.2.dylib, libGL.1.3.dylib creation into builds)

The tests built in builds don't require installation of the library.
